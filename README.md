# iOS-Libraries


# MVVM with Alamofire
## Requirements:
* iOS 13.0+
* Xcode 12 or above
* Swift 5.0

## Objective:
The objective of this sample is to fetch data from server using alamofire server and displayed data in table view using MVVM Design pattern.


## Installation

- Xcode **12**(required)
- Download the sample
- Clean `/DerivedData` folder if any
- Then clean and build the project in Xcode

## 3rd Party Libraries
 - **`Alamofire`** - [Alamofire/Alamofire](https://github.com/Alamofire/Alamofire) Elegant HTTP Networking in Swift.

## Technical notes:
- MVVM - My preferred architecture.
    - MVVM stands for “Model View ViewModel”
    - It’s a software architecture often used by Apple developers to replace MVC. Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM) is a structural design pattern that separates objects into three distinct groups:
- Models hold application data. They’re usually structs or simple classes.
- Views display visual elements and controls on the screen. They’re typically - subclasses of UIView.
- View models transform model information into values that can be displayed on a view. They’re usually classes, so they can be passed around as references.
